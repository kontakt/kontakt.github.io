JS-Game
=======

This is an idea I've been wanting to implement for a while.

I decided to work with JavaScript via Three.js because I want to become more experienced in JavaScript.

All my code is cobbled together with duct-tape and toothpicks, so don't expect massive performance.

Updates will be made in my spare time, whenever I get the enthusiasm to code more.

Thank you to everyone that has helped me get farther with my project, by directly answering my questions or indirectly having asked the dumb questions before me.
